Vibe FAB Notes
================

1. Fabrication

Double side PCB, 25mm x 33mm with multiple edges, board total thickness of ~0.063",  ENIG finish.

Note that bottom side of PCB has no traces, only pads for the through holes, so the bottom paste layer is empty. 

No impedance control.

1oz copper, FR4 or FR1 material.

Green solder mask.

Optional White Legend. The silk layers are provided for reference and for test boards and are not required on production boards.

Minimal clearance size: 7 mils. Minimal trace width: 6 mils. 

All holes plated though.

There are three internal milled slots specified in the drill hits file. These should be plated though.

The inlcuded top paste layer only includes SMD pads and does not include the bottom mounted jack and connectors. 

The inlcuded top paste layer matches the pad sizes with no shrink or swell and should be adjusted depending on stencil type and process.

MCP1 is an MSOP-10 package with 0.5mm pin pitch. Top mask and paste layers for this part may need to me adjusted depending on process. 


2. Assembly

Reflow soldering. 


3. Part orentation

Dot on silkscreen layer indicates the cathode on parts D1, D2, D3, RED, and WHITE. 

Parts D1, D2, and D3 are marked with a stripe on the cathode side.
