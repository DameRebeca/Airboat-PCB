Substitutions
=============
None of the parts are critical.

The resistors and capacitors can be substiuted for any suitable part within at least +/- 20% of value.

F1 can be repalced with any suitable 0603 fuse with minium 250mA blow current. It can also be repalced with an SMD 0.0OHM JUMPER 1/10W 0603, 
but doing so would reduce overcurrent and overvoltage protections. 

U1 can be substiutied with any part in the line, although changing to a ATTINY45 or ATTINY85 will require a recompile of the 
firmware, and changing to a different package will require changes to the footprint on the PCB.

L1 can be replace with different color pair part that has correct polarty and fits the pads.

M1 can be replaced with the same part in a different SOIC package, although this would require changes to the footprint on the PCB. 
This part has a variant MCP73831 that should *not* be substituted because it could potentially increase idle power usage.

Q1 can be replaced with any suitable N-Chan SOT23 MOSFET with the same pinout and minimum 30V/200mA. It must also have low leakage current 
becuase any leakage will contribute to idle power usage.
