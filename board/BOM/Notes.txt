The BOM file is in Digikey CSV format. 

None of the parts are critical.

The resistors and capacitors can be substiuted for any suitable part within at least +/- 20% of value.

The U1 can be substiutied with any part in the line, although changing to a 45 or 85 will require a recompile of the 
firmware, and changing to a different package will require changes to the footprint on the PCB.

LEDs can be changed out for any part that has correct polarty and fits the pads 

The battery charger chip M1 has a variant MCP73831 that should *not* be substituted without further testing becuase it could 
potentially cause idle power leakage.
